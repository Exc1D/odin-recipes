# Odin Recipe

A solo project by The Odin Project using the fundamentals of HTML.

In this project, I linked recipe pages to the main page using anchor tags. I also added classes and id's in case I'll be styling the pages in the future.

It may be a shameful thing to say especially for a guy like me who had already been coding for more than a month but in this project, I was reminded about the HTML boilerplate. Hopefully I'll master it without doubting myself if I added all the necessary meta tags.
